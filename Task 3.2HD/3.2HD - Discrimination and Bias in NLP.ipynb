    "# The big deal: word embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "Words must be represented as **numeric vectors** in order to be fed into machine learning algorithms. One of the most powerful (and popular) ways to do it is through **Word Embeddings**. In word embedding models, each word in a given language is assigned to a high-dimensional vector, such that **the geometry of the vectors captures relations between the words**. \n",

The resulting vector $g$ roughly encodes the concept of \"gender\".
